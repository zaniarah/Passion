# Passion
I almost lost my passion for something I knew I wanted to spend my life: technology. The goal of this is to 'get it back'. It's a random collection of ideas, codes, dreams. The aim of this is to escape from the world of technology as a job and reconnect with the idea of technology as a passion.
